* Custom menu height
* Scrollable menu content

<img src="https://github.com/tnhu/REMenu/raw/master/Demo.gif" alt="REMenu Screenshot" width="320" height="568" />

## Requirements
* Xcode 5 or higher
* Apple LLVM compiler
* iOS 6.0 or higher
* ARC

## Demo

Build and run the `REMenuExample` project in Xcode to see `REMenu` in action.

## Installation

### Manual Install

All you need to do is drop `REMenu.h` and `REMenu.m` files into your project, and add `#include "REMenu.h"` to the top of classes that will use it.

## Example Usage

Assuming you have a custom UIViewController named MainMenu in your Storyboard. In your UIViewController class

``` objective-c
@interface YOURViewController ()
  @property (strong, readwrite, nonatomic) REMenu *leftMenu;
@end
@implementation YOURViewController

- (void)viewDidLoad
{
  [super viewDidLoad];

  self.leftMenu = ({
    UIViewController *viewController = [[UIStoryboard storyboardWithName:@"Storyboard" bundle:NULL] instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier:@"MainMenu"];
    REMenu *leftMenu                 = [[REMenu alloc] initWithViewController:viewController menuHeight:5*44]; // 5 rows, 44 pixels each

    leftMenu;
  });
}
```

Which toggleLeftMenu implemented as:

``` objective-c
- (void)toggleLeftMenu
{
  if (self.leftMenu.isOpen) {
    return [self.leftMenu close];
  }

  [self.leftMenu showFromNavigationController:self.navigationController];
}
```

## Customization

You can customize the following properties of `REMenu`:

``` objective-c
@property (assign, readwrite, nonatomic) NSTimeInterval  animationDuration;
@property (assign, readwrite, nonatomic) NSTimeInterval  bounceAnimationDuration;
@property (assign, readwrite, nonatomic) BOOL            appearsBehindNavigationBar;
@property (assign, readwrite, nonatomic) BOOL            bounce;
```

## TODO
* Interaction between the view owns the menu and the menu view itself
